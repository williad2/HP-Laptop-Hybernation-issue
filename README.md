# HP-Laptop-Hybernation-issue
A number of HP laptops running windows 10 were recently patched causing changes to the systems sleep/hiberation settings.  Specifically changing the hyberation event to trigger every 2 minutes.

The impacted power settings in windows 10 are hidden by design and the method to undo these changes are difficult for many customers.
